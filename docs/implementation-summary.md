## Areas for Improvement

### Frontend

1. **TypeScript Errors**
   - Resolve TypeScript errors related to missing module declarations
   - These errors are due to the development environment not being properly set up with Node.js

2. **API Integration**
   - Fully connect frontend components to backend API instead of using simulated data
   - Implement proper error handling and loading states

3. **Environment Setup**
   - Install Node.js and npm to enable proper development environment
   - Run `npm install` to install all dependencies

### Backend

1. **Environment Configuration**
   - Set up proper environment variables for all services (MongoDB, OpenAI, AWS, Stripe)
   - Configure production deployment settings

2. **Security**
   - Implement proper rate limiting
   - Add additional security middleware
   - Ensure proper input validation and sanitization

## Deployment

1. **Frontend**
   - Deploy to Vercel for optimal Next.js performance
   - Configure custom domain and SSL

2. **Backend**
   - Deploy to Render or AWS for scalable backend services
   - Set up proper monitoring and logging

3. **Database**
   - Use MongoDB Atlas for managed database service
   - Configure backups and security settings

## Next Steps

1. **Development Environment Setup**
   - Install Node.js and npm
   - Run `npm run install:all` to install all dependencies
   - Start development servers with `npm run dev`

2. **Testing**
   - Implement comprehensive unit tests for frontend and backend
   - Add integration tests for API endpoints
   - Perform end-to-end testing of user flows

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implement code splitting for faster initial loads
   - Optimize database queries
   - Add caching for frequently accessed data

4. **Accessibility**
   - Ensure all components are accessible
   - Add proper ARIA labels and roles
   - Test with screen readers

5. **Internationalization**
   - Add support for multiple languages
   - Implement localization patterns
